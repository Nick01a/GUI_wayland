# GUI_wayland
This project is about creating Wayland GUI toolkit. As a compositor was used Weston.
Wayland is is a communication protocol that specifies the communication between a display server and its clients, as well as a C library implementation of that protocol.
A display server using the Wayland protocol is called a Wayland compositor, because it additionally performs the task of a compositing window manager.
To work with the cypher and we are using Pango library and to work with graphical display we are using Cairo library.
